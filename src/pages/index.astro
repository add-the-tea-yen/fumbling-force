			<h1>ðŸ‘¾ Hello, Person!</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to an early version of my blog, this is part thought dump for proses and poems as well ocassionaly stories?
				i dont know, just a creative outlet. Ill be making more adjustments such as;
				<li>adding a photography section (work in progress) </li> <!-- Maybe use mdx to like do modals and shit idk -->
				<li>a more organised way to look up posts</li> <!-- Probably organised by tags and dates -->
				<li>dark mode</li> <!-- Maybe multiple colors? -->
				<li>more spaced out, more terminal esq look</li>
				<li>replace this with something cooler</li>
				<li>comment section?</li>
				<p>
					While I could possibly give this blog more of a personality by idk torturing myself for a few hundred hours, integrating
					<a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> into a really cool tailwind-rotating-parallax-transformative-effects that
					change with breakpoints; without compramising on page load, i have learnt not to do that as it is not much more than a
					continious headache which i have to deal with every single time an aesthetic dies out.
