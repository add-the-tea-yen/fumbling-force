a secluded neurasthenic with a cigarette in hand  
drawn out by scheduled silent siren sounds of the dark  
to a waking dream  
infested with a bittersweet torment  
began a prudent transfiguration,  
into a constructed masterpiece,  
precise without oversight,
an affable companion to the vain;  

however, as an inauthentic invulnerability grew  
and linguistic longings lay scattered like
necessary nocturnal ambitions at dusk
with salient sentimentality and spirit subdued   
whilst impeded realities traversed through, and into this lucid dream;  
chasing this seemingly significant poignant pleasure,  
placed willfully out of reach  
the detritus of an inner war filled a cellar once possessing souvenirs from distant gratification;  
as the cellar grew colder, there is a nothing I became, an exhaustive void  
a soul conceived through expression, capable of animation  
now a collection of escapades and exploits devoid of deletion  
nothing but a vessel of fate
